# Lunch Date (Getting Started with Create React App)

Coding Boot Camp project 3. A system manage to meals on wheels distribution.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Motivation for development 

Lunch Date allows Home Care Workers to set a monthly Fresh Menu for aged care clients who can choose the quantity of meals they would like delivered as well as give special instructions for the meals delivered. 

Because Lunch Date captures the details of meal deliveries in a central location it allows for better planning of menus and efficient allocation of resources for this essential service.  

## User Story
AS A Home Care Worker
I WANT to create a monthly menu for a meals on wheels service
SO THAT I can keep record of a clients meal orders

## Acceptance Criteria
WHEN a new client is registered
THEN I can store their name and address
WHEN a new monthly is decided
THEN I can enter a fresh menu into the app
WHEN a customer is ready to order
THEN I enter the quantity of meals requested and and any special instructions into the customer's order 
WHEN all customer orders are received
THEN I can view the quantity of meals ordered on any given date and generate a delivery run sheet
WHEN a client claims that a meal was not recieved
THEN I can check the historical data to verify
WHEN I select a date in the future
THEN I can see a total of the number of meals required for that day so I can shop accordingly


## System Architecture and Flow

- Add image for concept

## Links to Deployed Application

## Mock-up

The following video shows an example of the functionality of the application:
 - Add link to video


 - Homepage - Login/Signup Screen

 - Landing page - presented with menu


## Installation Requirements
1. Installation of Microsoft Visual Studio
2. Open up Terminal within Microsoft and type in the following commands:
 - 
 -

## Future Developments
 - Add an admin user to view ALL orders
 - An electronic payment gateway can be intergrated into applciation, allowing the user to make an online payment ahead; instead of paying cash on collection of their order.
 - The menu to offer more modifications to the driks - such as amount of sugars, type of drink, drink temperature etc. 
 - Allowing the user to save their last order/ favourite drink for subsequent orders when they login into the application

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
